# Library-System

A CLI-based C++ application developed as a course project for the Object-Oriented Programming and Software Engineering courses at FMI. The system allows users to manage a digital library containing books, periodicals, and series. It supports both reader and administrator roles, with persistent storage and rich command-line interaction.

Some of the key features include:

 - user authentication and role-based access

 - book/periodical/series management

 - full-text search by title, author, or tags

 - support for borrowing, returning, and tracking overdue items

 - administrator-only commands for adding/editing/removing entries

 - paginated listings and dynamic command parsing

 - robust error handling and file validation

 - scalable architecture optimized for large data sets

The project is fully file-based and supports dynamic updates without loading the entire dataset into memory. Designed with extensibility and real-world use cases in mind.
